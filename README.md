#GreedySim

#####A program by Sydney Cardew

GreedySim is an (as of version 1.0.0 still crude and incomplete) self-playing version of my card game 'Too Greedily, Too Deep'. I wrote it both as a programming challenge and also in order to help me analyse and tweak the balance of the game. It is my hope that, as I improve the fidelity of the simulation and develop new ways to extract data about the simulation runs in aggregate, any unfair cards will be highlighted.

####Version History:

**Version 1.0.0**: 15/09/2020   
Description: First working version of GreedySim

####Future Development Goals:    

* Fully implement game rules and elements not currently implemented:
    * Voiding stacks
    * Item cards
    * The Escape Sequence
    * Missions
    * The Loan Shark
    * The Necromancer, Medic and other special power cards
    
* Institute a 'correct' solution for various currently existing workarounds
* Collect aggregate data about multiple simulations
* Improve AI and make more decisions governed by AI personalities
* Refactor code for readability and consistency and improve commenting
